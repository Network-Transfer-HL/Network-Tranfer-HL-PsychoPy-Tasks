Hi, I'm Charlotte Jeschina, a medical student and PhD Student at University of Lübeck.

My Project is called Netzwerk Transfer (Network Transfer) and is part of AG Marshall, Institute of experimental and cliinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Lübeck

These folders contain the scripts and stimuli for a Nonsense Wordpair (NSWP) and a Figure Paired-Association Task.
The tasks can be used with the Program PsychoPy.
Adaptation was done on a Desktop Computer or Laptop, while the Main Session with the full versions of the tasks is meant for the fMRI.
